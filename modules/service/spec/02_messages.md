# Messages

## Service Definition

The service definition can be created by any user via a `MsgDefineService`
message.

```go
type MsgDefineService struct {
    Name              string
    Description       string
    Tags              []string
    Author            sdk.AccAddress
    AuthorDescription string
    Schemas           string
}
```

**State modifications:**

- Create a new `ServiceDefinition`

This message is expected to fail if:

- `Name` does not satisfy the following:
  - begins with alphabetic charactors
  - consists of only alphanumerics, - and _
  - length ranges in (0,70]
- the length of `Description` exceeds 128 bytes
- the length of `AuthorDescription` exceeds 128 bytes
- `Tags` does not satisfy the following:
  - length of a single tag does not exceeds 70 bytes
  - total number does not exceeds 10
  - does not contain duplicate tags
- `Schemas` does not satisfy the following:
  - is a valid JSON object
  - contains the input and output object which are both valid JSON Schema
- the service definition with the `Name` already exists

## Service Binding

Any user who wants to provide a service can create a service binding via `MsgBindService`. Later, the service binding can be updated via `MsgUpdateServiceBinding`, diabled via `MsgDisableServiceBinding`, and enabled via `MsgEnableServiceBinding`.

The owner can refund deposit from an unavailable service binding after a period of time since disabled. The operation is via `MsgRefundServiceDeposit`

An owner can set an address to withdraw fees earned by its providers. The corresponding message is `MsgSetWithdrawAddress`

```go
type MsgBindService struct {
    ServiceName string
    Provider    sdk.AccAddress
    Deposit     sdk.Coins
    Pricing     string
    QoS         uint64
    Options     string
    Owner       sdk.AccAddress
}
```

**State modifications:**

- Create a new `ServiceBinding`

This message is expected to fail if:

- `Pricing` does not conform the `Pricing Schema`
- `QoS` is equal to 0 or greater than the system parameter `MaxRequestTimeout`
- `Options` is non-functional options
- the service definition with the `ServiceName` does not exist
- the service binding with the `ServiceName` and `Provider` already exists

```go
type MsgUpdateServiceBinding struct {
    ServiceName string
    Provider    sdk.AccAddress
    Deposit     sdk.Coins
    Pricing     string
    QoS         uint64
    Options     string
    Owner       sdk.AccAddress
}
```

    Owner       sdk.AccAddress
}
```

- the service binding is available

```go
type MsgRefundServiceDeposit struct {

    WithdrawAddress sdk.AccAddress
}
```

**State modifications:**

- Set a new withdrawal address for the owner

This message is expected to fail if:

- `WithdrawAddress` is empty

## Service Invocation

A consumer can initiate a service invocation via `MsgCallService`, and the targeting provider can respond to the request via `MsgRespondService`. After invocation, the consumer can update the created request context via `MsgUpdateRequestContext`. The request context can be paused via `MsgPauseRequestContext`, started via `MsgStartRequestContext`, terminated via `MsgKillReqeustContext` as well. The owner of the provider can withdraw the earned fees via `MsgWithdrawEarnedFees`

```go
type MsgCallService struct {
    ServiceName       string
    Providers         []sdk.AccAddress
    Consumer          sdk.AccAddress
    Input             string
    ServiceFeeCap     sdk.Coins
    Timeout           int64
    SuperMode         bool
    Repeated          bool

    Output    string           `json:"output"`
}
```
